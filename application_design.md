Designing an application to identify all possible address parts of an input string that accounts for spelling errors, abbreviations, dialectal differences, phonetics, and shorthand can be a complex task. Here is a possible outline of classes and methods that could be useful:

1. AddressParser class:

This class will be responsible for parsing the input address string and identifying its components. It can have the following methods:

    parse_address(input_address: str) -> List[AddressComponent]: 
        This method takes in the input address string and returns a list of AddressComponent objects, 
        each representing a specific component of the address, such as street name, house number, 
        city, postal code, etc.
    
    normalize_address(input_address: str) -> str: 
        This method takes in the input address string and normalizes it by removing any special 
        characters, converting abbreviations to their full forms, etc. This can help in reducing 
        the number of variations of an address that need to be handled.
    
    detect_language(input_address: str) -> str: 
        This method takes in the input address string and detects its language using language 
        detection techniques. This can be useful for handling dialectal differences in the address.
    
    identify_components(input_address: str, language: str) -> List[str]: 
        This method takes in the input address string and its language and identifies the possible 
        components in the address. This can be done using regular expressions, named entity 
        recognition, or other techniques.
    
    validate_components(components: List[str]) -> List[str]: 
        This method takes in the identified components and validates them using rules such as their 
        position in the address, their format, etc. This can help in reducing false positives and 
        handling spelling errors.
    
    create_address_components(components: List[str]) -> List[AddressComponent]: 
        This method takes in the validated components and creates a list of AddressComponent objects 
        with their corresponding types and values. This can be done using a lookup table or other 
        techniques.
    
    resolve_conflicts(components: List[AddressComponent]) -> List[AddressComponent]: 
        This method takes in the list of AddressComponent objects and resolves any conflicts between 
        them, such as multiple components with the same type or overlapping components.
    
    generate_possible_addresses(components: List[AddressComponent]) -> List[str]: 
        This method takes in the list of AddressComponent objects and generates all possible 
        variations of the address, taking into account any conflicting components or missing 
        components. This can be useful for handling shorthand or incomplete addresses.
    
    rank_possible_addresses(addresses: List[str]) -> List[str]: 
        This method takes in the list of possible addresses and ranks them based on their likelihood 
        of being the correct address. This can be done using heuristics such as the number of 
        matching components, the distance between components, etc.

2. AddressComponent class:

This class will represent a single component of an address, such as street name, house number, city, postal code, etc. It can have the following properties:

    component_type: str: A string indicating the type of the address component, such as "street_name", "house_number", "city", etc.
    value: str: The value of the address component, as parsed from the input address string.
    confidence: float: A confidence score indicating how certain the parser is about the value of this component.

Class: AddressComponent

Properties:

    component_type: str
    value: str
    confidence: float

Methods:

    init(self, component_type: str, value: str, confidence: float): Initializes a new instance of the AddressComponent class with the given component_type, value, and confidence.
    get_component_type(self) -> str: Returns the component_type of the AddressComponent.
    get_value(self) -> str: Returns the value of the AddressComponent.
    get_confidence(self) -> float: Returns the confidence score of the AddressComponent.

3. AddressMatcher class:

This class will be responsible for matching the parsed address components with a database of known addresses, in order to validate and correct the identified components. It can have the following methods:

    match_address(address_components: List[AddressComponent]) -> List[AddressComponent]: This method will take in a list of AddressComponent objects and return a list of validated and corrected AddressComponent objects, using a database of known addresses.

4. AddressDatabase class:

This class will represent the database of known addresses, and will be used by the AddressMatcher class to validate and correct the identified components. It can have the following methods:

    load_database(database_path: str): This method will load the address database from a file located at database_path.
    match_components(component_type: str, component_value: str) -> Tuple[str, float]: This method will take in an address component type and value, and return a tuple containing the best match found in the address database, along with a confidence score indicating the quality of the match.

5. PhoneticEncoder class:

This class will be used to encode address components into phonetic representations, in order to account for dialectal differences and phonetics. It can have the following method:

    encode_phonetic(component_value: str) -> str: This method will take in an address component value and return its phonetic representation.

6. SpellingCorrector class:

This class will be used to correct spelling errors in the address components, in order to account for spelling errors and shorthand. It can have the following method:

    correct_spelling(component_value: str) -> str: This method will take in an address component value and return its corrected spelling.

Using these classes and methods, you can create an application that can identify all possible address parts of an input string that accounts for spelling errors, abbreviations, dialectal differences, phonetics, and shorthand.
